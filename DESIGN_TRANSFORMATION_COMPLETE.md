# üé® STARTFINITY Design System Transformation - COMPLETE

## ‚úÖ **Transformation Overview**
**Problem Solved**: The website had multiple inconsistent color themes across pages (blue, purple, green, pink, orange, yellow, violet, emerald, amber) creating a chaotic, unprofessional appearance that undermined trust for a government benefits service provider.

**Solution Implemented**: Unified professional government-style design system using consistent primary blue theme throughout all components.
